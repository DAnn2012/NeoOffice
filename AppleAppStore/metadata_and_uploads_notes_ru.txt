Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on the OpenOffice office suite. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice and LibreOffice documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the „«NeoOffice» - поддержка“ link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• NeoOffice would fail to change the fill color of a shape in a Writer document after changing the fill color in the toolbar
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when dragging a table within an Impress document
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when running a print job on OS X Yosemite
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when cancelling both dialogs that appear after selecting the File > Printer Settings menu item in a Writer document
• When opening a document that contains linked OLE objects, NeoOffice would fail to display the "Update all links?" dialog and would automatically reload all linked OLE objects
