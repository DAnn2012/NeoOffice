Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Support for OS X Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
NeoOffice 3.x, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice users: before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "Support för NeoOffice" link and read the list of changes.

This version of NeoOffice adds support for OS X's native "speak selected text" feature. With this new feature, NeoOffice speaks your document's selected text when you press OS X's "speak selected text" key shortcut.

This version also includes fixes for the following bugs:

• When opening a new document while in full screen mode, the new document window would be displayed as a normal window instead of a full screen window
• After closing a full screen document window, in certain cases all windows would not be visible and only the active document's menubar would be visible
• When in a Calc document, merged cells could not be selected using the Shift and arrow keys
• When in a Calc document, editing a cell that has been scrolled off the edge of the document window would cause the cell's formula to be drawn in the wrong position
• When in a Calc document, the NeoOffice > Services menu would use text from the last selected combobox instead of the currently selected cell
• When in a Writer document, the NeoOffice > Services menu would use the last selected text even after unselecting all text
