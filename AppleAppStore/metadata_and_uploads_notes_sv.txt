Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "Support för NeoOffice" link and read the installation notes.

• NeoOffice would use white as the background color for toolbars and popup menus instead of light gray when running on macOS Mojave
• NeoOffice would crash due to LibreOffice bugs #94225, #103359, #103788, and #108124
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when displaying the Navigator window in Writer
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when starting a slideshow in Impress
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when opening or editing Writer documents
