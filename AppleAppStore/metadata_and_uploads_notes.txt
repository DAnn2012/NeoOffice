Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on the OpenOffice office suite. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice and LibreOffice documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "NeoOffice Support" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• When opening a document that contains linked images or files while in full screen mode, NeoOffice would display a modal dialog behind the full screen window and would appear to be frozen
• When displaying a presentation document while in full screen mode, NeoOffice would sometimes not use the whole screen and would leave an unused blank space on the screen
• When running a slideshow while in full screen mode, NeoOffice would exit full screen mode at the end of the slideshow
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when selecting a menu item
• NeoOffice would leak a small amount of memory when dragging text or images
