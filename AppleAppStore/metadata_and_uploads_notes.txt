Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• Native Dark Mode
• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "NeoOffice Support" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• While another application was using a lot of CPU, NeoOffice would freeze for several seconds when saving some Calc documents
• If the "jump to the spot that's clicked" preference was selected in the System Preferences application, clicking on a scrollbar in NeoOffice would only jump to the next page
• While running on macOS Mojave, NeoOffice would crash when switching into or out of Dark Mode while redrawing native controls
• While running on macOS Mojave, NeoOffice would crash when closing the popover attached to a document window's titlebar
• NeoOffice would crash due to LibreOffice bug #102233
