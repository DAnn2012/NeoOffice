Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• Native Dark Mode
• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "Support" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• NeoOffice would crash if a modal alert dialog is displayed while launching
• NeoOffice would fail to create autorecovery files for certain password protected documents due to LibreOffice bugs #93389 and #118639
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when changing the text direction while editing a cell in a Calc document
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when connecting to the macOS Contacts possibly due to LibreOffice bug #111634
• When running on a Mac with Retina display, NeoOffice would scale the resolution of some images with an alpha channel down to the resolution of a non-Retina display
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash due to RedHat bug #1301346
• When pasting to a Calc sheet that is completely selected, NeoOffice would sometimes freeze due to LibreOffice bugs #60021 and #96568
