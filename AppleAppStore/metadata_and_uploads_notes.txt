NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can read, create, and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. NeoOffice can open OpenOffice documents. NeoOffice can also open most Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Do you already use NeoOffice or OpenOffice? We recommend that you click on the NeoOffice support link and read the list of changes before you upgrade to this version of NeoOffice.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers - Patrick Luby and Ed Peterlin - have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice such as:

• Open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch using the NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu 
• OS X Gatekeeper
• OS X Versions
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Native file locking support for local and networked volumes
• OS X Services support
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
This version increases scrolling speed and fixes several crashing bugs. This version also fixes several bugs that occur when renaming a document or using the Versions feature.
