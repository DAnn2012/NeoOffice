NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can create and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. NeoOffice can open OpenOffice documents. NeoOffice can also open most Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Do you already use NeoOffice or OpenOffice? We recommend that you click on the NeoOffice support link and read the list of changes before you upgrade to this version of NeoOffice.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers - Patrick Luby and Ed Peterlin - have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice such as:

• Open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch using the NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu 
• OS X Gatekeeper
• OS X Versions
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Native file locking support for local and networked volumes
• OS X Services support
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
This version fixes the slow scrolling bug when swiping on the trackpad that some of our users found in the previous version.

In addition to the slow scrolling bug, this version fixes the following bugs:

• NeoOffice would occassionally hang when dragging an image within a particular Writer document
• NeoOffice would crash when pressing an arrow key in an empty field in Base's query design window
• NeoOffice would crash when opening a particular Writer file with comments
• NeoOffice would crash when opening a particular .svg image file with gradients
• NeoOffice would create two duplicate versions instead of one version in the OS X Versions browser each time a document was saved
• NeoOffice would display an uncloseable window if the document window was closed while in the OS X Versions browser
• NeoOffice would sometimes display a blank popover window when clicking on the downward arrow icon next to the document name in a document window's titlebar while running on OS X 10.9
