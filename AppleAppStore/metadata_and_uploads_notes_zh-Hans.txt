Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "NeoOffice 支持" link and read the installation notes.

This version is a new version of NeoOffice that is based on LibreOffice. While previous versions of NeoOffice were based on the OpenOffice code, NeoOffice 2017 is based on the LibreOffice 4.4 code.

We switched to the LibreOffice 4.4 code because the LibreOffice code is able to open and save Microsoft Office .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx documents with fewer errors than the OpenOffice code.
