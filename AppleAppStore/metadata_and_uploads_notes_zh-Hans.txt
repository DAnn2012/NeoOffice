Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Support for OS X Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
NeoOffice 3.x, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice users: before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "NeoOffice 支持" link and read the list of changes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• NeoOffice no longer pauses after several swipes. NeoOffice's swipe event handling code would sometimes pause for a moment if the user swiped several times in a row.
• Swiping or moving the scroll wheel very slowly will now move only a single line or row at a time. Before, NeoOffice would randomly jump 2 or 3 lines when swiping or moving the scroll wheel very slowly.
• When swiping or moving the scroll wheel rapidly, the page or row number tooltip no longer flickers rapidly. The flickering tooltip was caused by NeoOffice's underlying OpenOffice code closing and reopening the tooltip after each swipe or scrolling event.
