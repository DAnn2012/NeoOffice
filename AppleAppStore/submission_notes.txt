This app is a version of the widely used NeoOffice office productivity software and is a complete set of office applications that users can use to create and edit spreadsheets, text documents, and presentations.

- OS X Versions
- OS X Full-Screen mode
- Significant speed improvements to the OpenOffice and LibreOffice text layout, rendering, and printing code
- Native OS X text highlighting
- Native file locking support for local and networked volumes
