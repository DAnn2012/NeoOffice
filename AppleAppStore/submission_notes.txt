Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete set of office applications. NeoOffice is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice so it is far from perfect. But NeoOffice can create and edit spreadsheets, text documents, and presentations.

While there is no free support and NeoOffice has many of the same bugs as OpenOffice, the NeoOffice engineers - Patrick and Ed - work exclusively on improving the stability of the OpenOffice code and adding native features such as:

- OS X Full-Screen mode
- Open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch using the NeoOffice :: Open at Launch menu 
- OS X Versions
- Significant speed improvements to the OpenOffice and LibreOffice text layout, rendering, and printing code
- Native OS X text highlighting
- Native file locking support for local and networked volumes
- OS X Services support
- Native floating tool windows
