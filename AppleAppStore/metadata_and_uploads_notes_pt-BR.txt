Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Support for OS X Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
NeoOffice, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice users: before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "Suporte para NeoOffice" link and read the list of changes.

This version of NeoOffice includes significantly faster handling of lengthy, 100+ page documents with tables.

Previous versions of NeoOffice could temporarily hang when opening, editing, saving, printing, exporting to PDF, or previewing lengthy documents with tables. This hanging was due to NeoOffice recalculating the document's page breaks and table cell sizes. To avoid such hanging, the NeoOffice engineers have made the following changes:

• When opening, editing, or saving Writer documents, NeoOffice now recalculates page breaks and table cell sizes in the background in small chunks over the course of a few minutes. By deferring the recalculation, you no longer need to wait for the recalculation to finish before you can continue editing your document.
• When printing, exporting to PDF, or previewing Writer documents, NeoOffice now displays a dialog if recalculating page breaks and table cell sizes takes more than 30 seconds. This dialog gives you the option to cancel the recalculation. If you cancel the recalculation, NeoOffice uses rough guesses to set page breaks and table cells and immediately proceeds to printing, exporting to PDF, or previewing your document.
