Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Support for OS X Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "Suporte para NeoOffice" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• NeoOffice would ignore most keystrokes when typing many common Indic language words
• Any color settings for changes in Writer documents that were set to "By author" or "[None]" would be unset when quitting NeoOffice
• NeoOffice would crash when opening LibreOffice HTML files that contain images
• NeoOffice would crash when rendering Indic characters using the "Arial Unicode MS" font
