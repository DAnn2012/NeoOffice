Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Support for OS X Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "Suporte para NeoOffice" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• When exporting a document to PDF, NeoOffice would not include any characters that use the Apple Color Emoji font
• In compressed and stretched horizontal text, NeoOffice would compress or stretch the text less than the text's "Scale width" setting
• In compressed and stretched vertical text, NeoOffice would compress or stretch Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters horizontally instead of vertically
• In fontwork objects that have multiple lines of text, NeoOffice would draw all but the first line of text too far to the right
• NeoOffice would sometimes hang when opening .odb files
• When running on OS X Mountain Lion, NeoOffice would ignore changes to the file name in the Save As dialog and would save to the original file name
• When using an 800 x 600 or smaller monitor, NeoOffice would cut off the buttons at the bottom of tall dialogs
