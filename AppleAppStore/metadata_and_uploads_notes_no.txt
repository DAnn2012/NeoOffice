Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the «Støtte for NeoOffice» link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• When running on macOS Mojave, NeoOffice would freeze when dragging
• NeoOffice would not display any of the Command-Option menu shortcuts that are in NeoOffice's underlying LibreOffice 4.4 code
• When running in macOS Dark Mode, NeoOffice would display the incorrect text color while editing a comment in a Calc document that was previous saved by LibreOffice, by OpenOffice, or by NeoOffice not running in Dark Mode
