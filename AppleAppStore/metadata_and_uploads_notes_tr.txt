Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on the OpenOffice office suite. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice and LibreOffice documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows

• NeoOffice would take 20 - 30 minutes to open spreadsheet documents that contain thousands of unique cell styles
• NeoOffice would sometimes freeze when unlocking a Dropbox or iCloud document in the document's titlebar popup window
• When running NeoOffice on macOS Sierra, both horizontal and vertical scrolling using the trackpad was several times more sensitive than on earlier versions of OS X
• When running NeoOffice on macOS Sierra, NeoOffice would crash when creating a database using the Database Wizard
• NeoOffice would crash if you pressed the Command-w keys while a print dialog was displayed
