NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, PDF files, and most Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice 3.x and OpenOffice users: before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the »Support til NeoOffice« link and read the list of changes.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice such as:

• Open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch using the NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu 
• OS X Versions
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Native file locking support for local and networked volumes
• OS X Services support
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, click on the »Planamesa Inc.s websted« link and try NeoOffice for free. This version of NeoOffice adds support for OS X Yosemite's new iCloud Drive feature. We have made significant changes to NeoOffice's native file locking code to safely open, save, or delete files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives.

This version of NeoOffice also includes fixes for the following bugs:
• NeoOffice would randomly crash when checking if a document has been moved or renamed
• NeoOffice would only display the first image in many .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx documents
