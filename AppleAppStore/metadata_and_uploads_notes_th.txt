Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can read, create, and edit OpenOffice documents, PDF files, and most Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice 3.x and OpenOffice users: before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "การสนับสนุน NeoOffice" link and read the list of changes.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice such as:

• Open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch using the NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu 
• OS X Gatekeeper
• OS X Versions
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Native file locking support for local and networked volumes
• OS X Services support
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, click on the "เว็บไซต์ของ Planamesa Inc." link and try NeoOffice for free. This version of NeoOffice adds automatic grammar checking. When you spellcheck a document in Writer, NeoOffice now automatically does grammar checking using the OS X grammar checker.

NeoOffice 2013.x users: NeoOffice is now a 64 bit application. Most NeoOffice 2013.x users should not notice any changes in this version. However, the small number of users that use third-party ODBC drivers and native extensions will need to obtain 64 bit versions of their third-party ODBC drivers and native extensions. Click on the "การสนับสนุน NeoOffice" link to see steps for configuring MySQL's ODBC driver to work with NeoOffice 2014.1.
