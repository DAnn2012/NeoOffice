Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is a complete office suite for OS X. With NeoOffice, users can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

NeoOffice is extremely stable and thousands of users use it daily. The NeoOffice engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time.

Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that users will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native OS X grammar checking
• Native OS X text highlighting
• Support for OS X Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
NeoOffice 3.x, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice users: before you buy NeoOffice, we recommend that you click on the "การสนับสนุน NeoOffice" link and read the list of changes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• NeoOffice would sometimes crash when quitting
• When saving .ods files that were originally created in OpenOffice or LibreOffice, NeoOffice would require the user to reset the password for each protected sheet
• When clicking on cells in .ods files that were originally created in LibreOffice, NeoOffice would fail to select any cells in protected sheets
• NeoOffice would draw punctuation characters in Japanese vertical text in the wrong position and with horizontal font glyphs
• When querying for null values in spreadsheet data sources, empty cells would be treated as if they were not null
• When sending a mail merge to a file instead of to the printer, NeoOffice would fail to create the mail merge file
