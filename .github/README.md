NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

Native Dark Mode
Native accents menu by holding down a key on the keyboard
Native tabs by enabling the "Prefer tabs" system preference
Native full screen mode
NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
Native Mac grammar checking
Native Mac text highlighting
Support for Mac Services
Native floating tool windows
